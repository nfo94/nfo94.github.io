I have been a software developer for a little over 4 years, graduated in Systems
Analysis and Development from Unifacs. I have fullstack experience and am
currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Data Engineering at Instituto Infnet.

The articles I write here are part of my studies and reflections. Enjoy!
